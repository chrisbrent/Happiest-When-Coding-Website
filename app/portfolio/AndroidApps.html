      <h4>Jo-Ann Fabric &amp; Craft</h4>
      <p>
        Jo-Ann stores were the first client to use a product we'd named "RedShop Mobile".
        RedShop Mobile was a collection of tools aimed at building mobile apps and websites for eCommerce clients who didn't have the techinal team to implement their own.
        This usually meant that a client had few to no techinal resources and generally no availible product listing API.
        By running a cluster of headless <a href="https://www.seleniumhq.org/">Selenium</a> browsers we were able to parse a website once a day for an up to date product listing.
        This was stored in a SQL Sever database and served to the Android, iOS and mobile website.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Jo-Ann we also integrated a store locator provided via CSV file, and a weekly mailer from a third party vendor.
        We also expanded RedShop Mobile to include a mobile wallet for storing coupons as well as an admin UI for adding those coupons.
      </p>
      <p>
        My inital role was to write the parser to get a minimum viable product API, and build a prototype iOS app.
        I assisted in building the prototype Android app.
        Once the project was accepted by the client we built out all the required functionally for both iOS and Android.
        At that point a large offshore team was engaged for ongoing feature requests and maaintenance.
